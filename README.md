This is a simple user data app

## Legend
This app is designed to create new users either from visual html form or .json files.

## Task

There are some issues with this app. Please, try to find these types of drawbacks:

### 1. Code Architecture

Is there any way to simplify the current code?

### 2. Data Validation

Our app receives user data both from HTTP requests & .json files.

Which ways can be used to ensure user data is valid?

### 3. Database Security

Let's take a look at how we operate with our database.

Are our DB queries secure?

### 4. Deployment

Let's suppose our clients want to see our application in action.

What important steps should be taken to prepare our application for production usage?

### 5. Production issues

Let's imagine our application has already reached a production environment.
Our clients are happy to use it, but some of them experience some issues.

How do we meet these kind of issues? How can we track our application activity?
